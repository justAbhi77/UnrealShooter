# Unreal TPS 
In this project I created a small shooter project Unreal Editor([Link](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US)) using cpp.
The Course([Unreal Engine 4 C++ The Ultimate Shooter Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-the-ultimate-shooter-course/)) I followed is created by Stephen Ulibarri([Link](https://www.udemy.com/user/stephen-ulibarri-3/))

PS. This is the final project with the last couple of commits. The actual repo is hosted at Azure Devops([Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/user-guide/what-is-azure-devops?view=azure-devops)).
